## Workflow to Utilize Plasmidfinder for Inc Typing.
### Usage

```

===============================================
 TAPIR Plasmidfinder Pipeline version 1.0dev
===============================================

 Usage:
        The typical command for running the pipeline is as follows:
        nextflow run main.nf --input "PathTosamplesheet" --outdir "PathToOutputDir" 

        Mandatory arguments:
         --input                        Sample sheet containing 'sample' column and 'fasta' column
         --outdir                       Output directory (e.g., "/MIGE/01_DATA/plasmidfinder_out")


         Helpful arguments:
        	--help                         This usage statement.
         	--version                      Version statement
